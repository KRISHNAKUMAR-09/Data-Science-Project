# _Introduction_
  The Content and Popularity-Based Recommendation System utilizes two approaches to generate movie recommendations for users. It combines the content-based filtering technique, which recommends items based on their similarities to the items previously liked by the user, with the popularity-based filtering technique, which recommends items based on their overall popularity among all users.

# _Dataset_
  The project utilizes a two TMBD dataset for training and testing. The dataset consists of 17101 rows and 22 columns. It contain null values and duplicate entries.

# _Objectives_
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

   1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
   2. Prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.
   3. Understand the relationships between variables using visualization techniques.
   4. Apply NLP techniques. 
   

# _Recommendation System_
  Build a Content-Based Recommendation System: Utilize the CountVectorizer technique to convert textual data into a numerical representation and apply cosine_similarity to measure the similarity between different movies based on their content. Develop a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the preferences of a user.

   Build a Popularity-Based Recommendation System: Use the MinMaxScaler technique to normalize popularity metrics, such as the number of ratings or average ratings, for each movie. Develop a popularity-based recommendation system that suggests popular movies to users.

# Results
  By achieving these objectives, I will create a recommendation system that combines content-based and popularity-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.
